# [Issue Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/issue-tracker)

This is my solution to the freeCodeCamp Quality Assurance certification: Issue Tracker.

## Setting up the server
For this challenge I used [Glitch](glitch.com). If you wish to do the same follow the next steps:
1. Go to the [freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-issuetracker repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-issuetracker).
2. Click on the green button that says code and copy the clone url.
3. Go to [glitch.com](glitch.com) and create an account or register.
4. Click on new project (next to your profile picture, up right)
5. Select last option: Import from Github.
6. Paste the previusly copied URL and accept. 
7. Done! You should now be able to code the answer in there.

To complete the challenges just click on share and copy the live site URL and use it as the solution link on your freecodecamp challenge.
